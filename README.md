# Webhooks.io URL Helper

Takes a url and converts it to a dynamic url that can be used as a dynamic destination URL.  This removes the need to setup an explicit destination per endpoint.

Details on how Dynamic Destinations work can be found in our [documenation](http://www.webhooks.io/docs/relay/dynamic-destinations).
